## 4W's and 1'H

### Who:
This will take speech samples from the user and tests against the available data of speech samples.

### What:
It is a MATLAB coded implementation where it can detect the user's voice.


### When:
This can have huge benefits especially for those people who are suffering from some kind of disabilities.
People are restricted to show their hidden talent and creativity.

### Where:
The implementation can be used in smartphones, laptops for authentication.

### How:
The implementation is based on MFCC Feature extraction.
