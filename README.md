# System Development Life Cycle of Speech Recognition
## Phases
### Planning:
* Defining the scope of the system
> To identify a speaker based on his speech sample.
* Feasibility study
* Estimate costs
> The project is feasible to the extent where speech sample of a particular doesn’t get tampered or the speaker tries to imitate other voices.
> This is a simple project that was done completely on software, so there’s nothing that costs other than time.
> However, if we are trying to build a hardware device based on this implementation, the cost part comes into picture.

### Analysis:
* Locating existing deficiencies
> There has been a lot of advancement in speech recognition technology, but still it has huge scope.
> Speech based devices find their applications in our daily lives and have huge benefits especially for those people who are suffering from some kind of disabilities.
* Define the requirements
> Speech based devices find their applications in our daily lives and have huge benefits especially for those people who are suffering from some kind of disabilities.
> We can also use these speech based devices for security measures to reduce cases of fraud and theft.
* High level Requirements
> MATLAB Coding, Basic understanding of analysing speech signals.
* Low level Requirements
> Knowledge on MFCC feature extraction process.
